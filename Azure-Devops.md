# Evolve your DevOps practices

DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to your end users. Azure DevOps is a set of services that gives you the tools you need to do just that. With Azure DevOps, you can build, test, and deploy any application, either to the cloud or on premises. DevOps practices that enable transparency, cooperation, continuous delivery and continuous deployment become embedded in your software development lifecycle.

## Assess your existing software development process

### The team's release process

The first step to setting up a DevOps practice is to assess your current process. This means analyzing:

-   Your existing artifacts, such as deployment packages and NuGet, as well as your container repositories.
-   Your existing test management tools.
-   Your existing work management tools.

### Assess process efficiency with value stream maps

Creating a value stream map, or VSM, helps you analyze your current release cycle process. The purpose of a VSM is to visually show where in the process a team creates value and where there's waste. The goal, of course, is to arrive at a process that delivers maximum value to the customer with minimum waste. A VSM can help you pinpoint those areas that either don't contribute any value or that actually reduce the value of the product.

## Get started with Azure DevOps

### What is DevOps?

DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users

-   **Agile planning**.
    Together, we'll create a backlog of work that everyone on the team and in management can see. We'll prioritize the items so we know what we need to work on first. The backlog can include user stories, bugs, and any other information that helps us.

-   **Continuous integration (CI)**.
    We'll automate how we build and test our code. We'll run that every time a team member commits changes to version control.

-   **Continuous delivery (CD)**.
    CD is how we test, configure, and deploy from a build to a QA or production environment.
    Monitoring. We'll use telemetry to get information about an application's performance and usage patterns. We can use that information to improve as we iterate.

-   **Deploy more frequently**
    In fact, some teams deploy up to dozens of times per day.
    Practices such as monitoring, continuous testing, database change management, and integrating security earlier in the software development process help elite performers deploy more frequently, and with greater predictability and security.

-   **Reduce lead time from commit to deploy**
    Lead time is the time it takes for a feature to make it to the customer. By working in smaller batches, automating manual processes, and deploying more frequently, elite performers can achieve in hours or days what once took weeks or even months.

-   **Reduce change failure rate**
    A new feature that fails in production or that causes other features to break can create a lost opportunity between you and your users. As high-performing teams mature, they reduce their change failure rate over time.

-   **Recover from incidents more quickly**
    When incidents do occur, elite performers are able to recover more quickly. Acting on metrics helps elite performers recover more quickly while also deploying more frequently.

### What is Azure DevOps?

-   **Azure Boards**
    These are agile tools that help us plan, track, and discuss our work, even with other teams.

-   **Azure Pipelines**
    These will let us build, test, and deploy with CI/CD that works with any language, platform, and cloud.

-   **Azure Test Plans**
    These are manual and exploratory testing tools.

-   **Azure Repos**
    These provide unlimited, cloud-hosted private, and public Git repos.

-   **Azure Artifacts**
    These let us create, host, and share packages.

### Measures

**Faster Outcomes**

-   Deployment Frequency. Increasing the frequency of deployments is often a critical driver in DevOps teams.
-   Deployment Speed. As well as increasing how often deployments happen, it's important to decrease the time that they take.
-   Deployment Size. How many features, stories, and bug fixes are being deployed each time?
    Lead Time. How long does it take from starting on a work item, until it is deployed?

**Efficiency**

-   Server to Admin Ratio. Are the projects reducing the number of administrators required for a given number of servers?
-   Staff Member to Customers Ratio. Is it possible for fewer staff members to serve a given number of customers?
-   Application Usage. How busy is the application?
-   Application Performance. Is the application performance improving or dropping? (Based upon application metrics.)

**Quality and Security**

-   Deployment Failure Rates. How often do deployments (and/or applications) fail?
-   Application Failure Rates. How often do application failures occur, such as configuration failures, performance timeouts, and so on?
-   Mean Time to Recover. How quickly can you recover from a failure?
-   Bug Report Rates. You don't want customers finding bugs in your code. Is the amount they are finding increasing or decreasing?
-   Test Pass Rates. How well is your automated testing working?
-   Defect Escape Rate. What percentage of defects are being found in production?
-   Availability. What percentage of time is the application truly available for customers?
-   SLA Achievement. Are you meeting your service level agreements (SLAs)?
-   Mean Time to Detection. If there is a failure, how long does it take for it to be detected?

**Culture**

-   Employee Morale. Are employees happy with the transformation and where the organization is heading? Are they still willing to respond to further changes?
-   Retention Rates. Is the organization losing staff?

**Common quality metrics**

-   Failed Builds Percentage - Overall, what percentage of builds are failing?
-   Failed Deployments Percentage - Overall, what percentage of deployments are failing?
-   Ticket Volume - What is the overall volume of customer bug tickets?
-   Bug Bounce Percentage - What percentage of customer or bug tickets are being reopened?
-   Unplanned Work Percentage - What percentage of the overall work being performed is unplanned?

## Choose an Agile approach to software development

### What is Agile?

-   Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
-   Working software over comprehensive documentation
-   Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
-   Responding to change over following a plan

### What is Azure Boards?

There are four processes to choose from. We can use:

-   **Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)**. This is really for large organizations and it's pretty complicated so I didn't use it.
-   **Scrum**. Scrum depends on a Scrum master who leads the Scrum team. The Scrum master makes sure everybody understands Scrum theory, practices, and rules. We don't have a Scrum master; that's someone who's usually received some training and certification so I didn't pick that one either.
-   **Agile**. This seemed like the obvious choice since I'm always talking about Agile, but it has a few more things to consider than the simplest option.
-   **Basic**. Basic is, well, basic. It's simple but gives us enough power to start doing effective planning right away, and that's why I picked it. In the Basic workflow, you move work from To Do to Doing to Done.
